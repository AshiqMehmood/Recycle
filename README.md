## **Our Project**

Thiruvananthapuram Municipal Corporation (TMC) has been following decentralized
solid waste management and encourages on-site management of biodegradable discards since
2013. We were able to understand that the major initiatives in Thiruvananthapuram city over
the last 3 years were regarding solid waste management and to turn it into a green city. The
following initiatives were taken under the program to drive the change:-

1. Green protocol implementation
2. Decentralized Waste Management
3. Green Army - a platform where individuals & groups work with school students to
educate them about segregated waste management and other sustainable living
practices in an urban environment
4. Waste management awareness festivals
5. Zero waste ward initiative
    
Our team identified a need for an impact analysis of these initiatives and
generate performance models that could be used to implement the above initiatives in other
districts in Kerala. Multiple innovative solid waste management technologies were also
implemented along with the drive in different parts of Trivandrum, and the impact analysis
along with regression analysis and optimization of the same were other requirements that we
have identified. In our project, we would include:-

* Data collection from various organisations, government bodies, health inspectors and
Green Army volunteers across the city. (Ref. 1)
* Engaging with recognised organisations in the field of solid waste management to
identify Key Performance Indicators.
* Identifying and generating models to optimize the new technologies that were
implemented as part of the initiative.
* To do a regression analysis of existing inflow and outflow, and assist government
agencies in identifying gaps and engage in capacity building activities.
* Generate a template for easy implementation of the above initiatives in other districts.
